    <p>As a student in ASTU, I experienced a lot of things including social life, struggle, starvation, living together, knowledge and most importantly friendship. </p>
    <p>These things that i mentioned are common things one can obtain from any university in my county but the one thing i found different in ASTU is "Survival of the Fittest" it is a phrase that i learned in Biology class when i was in highschool which can define if you can not fit your society, you won't stay.I said this because ASTU has it's own learning schedule and special courses which other universities don't take one of them is the programming language Python which is given during freshman year and Applied maths that is common course for all departments in ASTU which many students find it difficult that leads to the failure dissmisal of the students.</p><br>
    <p>Consequently most of the students which i met during freshman year where dismissed or left the university because they came without a goal or an aim so that they got distracted by other stuff than learning.</p>
    <p>Additionaly peer pressure is a thing that changes people's mind and life too.</p>
    <p>In conclusion Everyone should be aware of themselves, their capabilities and  interests before joining ASTU because, most of my friends that i met there left because of the things i mentioned above.</p>
